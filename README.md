- 💵 marks [Non-Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) content: commercial content that may require any kind of payment.

Due to the fast-moving nature of the topic, entries in the list may be removed at an expedited rate until the ecosystem matures.

See [Contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## TL;DR

The easiest way to get started for most people is to pick one of the available [GUIs](https://github.com/awesome-stable-diffusion/awesome-stable-diffusion/blob/main/README.md#guis) based on the desired platform and follow it's installation instructions.

Alternatively, most of the more developed forks (such as InvokeAI) come with their own user interfaces.


## Official Resources

* **[CompVis/Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)** - The official release of Stable Diffusion including a CLI, an AI-based Safety Classifier, which detects and suppresses sexualized content, and all the necessary files to get running.
* [stability-AI/stability-sdk](https://github.com/stability-AI/stability-sdk) - The official SDK used to build python applications integrated with StabilityAI's cloud platform instead of hosting the model locally. Operation requires an API Key (🖊️💵).

## Actively Maintained Forks and Containers

All forks listed here add additional features and optimisations and are generally faster than the original release, as they keep the model in memory rather than reloading it after every prompt. Most forks seem to remove the Safety Classifier which may present a risk if used to provide public-facing services, such as Discord bots.
