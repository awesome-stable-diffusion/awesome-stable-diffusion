## TL;DR

The easiest way to get started for most people is to pick one of the available [GUIs](https://github.com/awesome-stable-diffusion/awesome-stable-diffusion/blob/main/README.md#guis) based on the desired platform and follow it's installation instructions.

Alternatively, most of the more developed forks (such as InvokeAI) come with their own user interfaces.

To get up and running, one usually needs:
- A GUI or CLI based installation on a supported platform (usually NVIDIA GPU but support for Apple Silicon, AMD GPUS and even CPU exists in some branches)
- The weights (.ckpt files) for the model downloaded from Huggingface
- Sufficent RAM/VRAM available on the system.

## Actively Maintained Forks and Containers

All forks listed here add additional features and optimisations and are generally faster than the original release, as they keep the model in memory rather than reloading it after every prompt. Most forks seem to remove the Safety Classifier which may present a risk if used to provide public-facing services, such as Discord bots. The two most popular forks at this point are Automatic1111 and InvokeAI

## Checkpoints and Weights

Checkpoints (.ckpt files) must be separately downloaded and are required to run Stable Diffusion. The latest stability ai release is 2.1. The last model containing NSFW concepts was 1.5 released by RunwayML.

For 2.x releases, there is a 768x768px resolution capable model trained off the base model (512x512 pixels). You need **one** of these models to use stable diffusion and generally want to chose the latest one that fits your needs.
