## Official Resources

* **[CompVis/Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)** - The official release of Stable Diffusion including a CLI, an AI-based Safety Classifier, which detects and suppresses sexualized content, and all the necessary files to get running.
* [stability-AI/stability-sdk](https://github.com/stability-AI/stability-sdk) - The official SDK used to build python applications integrated with StabilityAI's cloud platform instead of hosting the model locally. Operation requires an API Key (üñäÔ∏èüíµ).
